#### Overview:

Long disgusted by the poor mobile support of Canvas System (Our online teaching platform), I developed this mobile Canvas App, with some of the essential functions of the real Canvas System, and some utilities. 

For sure, U cannot actually submit homework in this app, as all the data are loaded via local database and simulative json files, so I name it Homework Submission Simulator, in which u can feel the thrill of handing in all the homework at a time. ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ

#### Functions:

+ Dashboard Timeline, listing the assignments with information like submission status and time, etc., and self-added notifications ordered by due time, all of which in concert with the UI style of the Canvas Dashboard.
+ Submission Page, showing all the information of the assignment, and you can choose a file to submit.
+ Filter by course and type (personal notification or course assignments).
+ Curriculum Page listing all the courses of this semester and last enrollments.
+ Curriculum Timetable
+ Curriculum Page with three tabs: Assignment list, syllabus and detailed information with visualization and a Baidu map widget showing the lecture location.
+ All the data on the timeline are maintained in a dataset. Other data, such as Curriculum Timetable data, are loaded from self-defined json file.
