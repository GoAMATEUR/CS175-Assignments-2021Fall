## Overview

I simply re-implement the provided example using Kotlin. In this todolist app:

+ Click the add button to add tasks and assign its priority
+ All the tasks are shown on home page in descending priority order. Tasks with different priorities have different color annotations
+ Task database management

In the process, I got a better understanding of storage and permission in Android.
